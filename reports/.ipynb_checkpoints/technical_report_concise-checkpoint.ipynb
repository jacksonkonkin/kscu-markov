    "# KSCU Wallet-Share Markov Challenge: AI-Powered Member Behavior Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Jackson Konkin  \n",

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents an AI-powered Markov chain solution for KSCU's critical business challenge: predicting member behavior and wallet share evolution to strengthen engagement and prevent attrition. Using 6 quarters of synthetic data for ~5,000 members, I developed an enhanced Markov model that achieves **85.2% accuracy** in state predictions and **68.5% F1-score** for identifying departing members—a **67% improvement** over baseline approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Results:**\n",
    "- **Revenue Protection:** $850K+ annually through improved LEAVE detection\n",
    "- **Predictive Accuracy:** 85.2% overall accuracy, 0.033 MAE for wallet share forecasting\n",
    "- **Business Impact:** Interactive AI prototype enabling scenario testing for strategic decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution directly addresses KSCU's core questions: predicting member transitions, forecasting wallet share evolution, and quantifying intervention impacts."

    "## 1. The Business Problem: Share of Wallet in Retail Banking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Challenge\n",
    "KSCU faces a fundamental retention challenge: understanding when members will **stay**, **split** their banking, or **leave** entirely. Share of wallet—the percentage of a member's total banking conducted with KSCU—is the key metric that determines:\n",
    "- Member lifetime value and revenue\n",
    "- Attrition risk and intervention needs\n",
    "- Strategic product and service decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions Addressed\n",
    "1. **What is the probability this member will stay, split, or leave next quarter?**\n",
    "2. **How will wallet share evolve under different strategies?**\n",
    "3. **What impact does digital adoption have on attrition risk?**\n",
    "4. **How do new products affect member relationships?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Stakes\n",
    "With ~1,250 members at risk annually and average member value of $2,500/year, improving LEAVE detection from 41% to 69% saves **$850,000 annually** in prevented attrition."
