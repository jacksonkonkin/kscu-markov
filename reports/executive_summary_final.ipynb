    "- **Lost revenue** from departing high-value members\n",
    "- **Poor early detection** of at-risk members (only 41% accuracy for LEAVE prediction)\n",
    "- **Missed intervention opportunities** due to late identification\n",
    "- **Inefficient resource allocation** for retention efforts\n",
